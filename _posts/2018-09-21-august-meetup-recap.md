We had a great time at [The Home Depot](https://careers.homedepot.com/career-areas/technology-careers/) where we joined forces with the [Atlanta Apple Admins](https://www.facebook.com/atlantaappleadmins/) meetup group for a multi-site meetup! Thanks again to [Chris Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-miller-27551212/) of [Eanes ISD](https://www.eanesisd.net/dept/tech/staff) for his demo of the Tightrope App for digital signage, and [Emily Kausalik-Whittle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilykausalik/) for her discussion on building VMs for DEP and MDM enrollment testing. And special thanks to [Jamf](https://www.jamf.com) and Heather Adel for providing pizza to both locations!

Below are the assets from the meetup, including the main deck and a recording of the Facebook Live video.
