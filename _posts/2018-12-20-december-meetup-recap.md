We had a great time at [The Home Depot](https://careers.homedepot.com/career-areas/technology-careers/) where we heard from Stephen Short of [Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/about-us) about TCC and building PPPC profiles for Macs running macOS Mojave. And special thanks to [Jamf](https://www.jamf.com) and Heather Adel for providing pizza!

Below are the assets from the meetup, including the main deck, presentation slides, and a recording of the Facebook Live video.
