January 16, 2019 - New Year Happy Hour

---

New Year, new happy hour meetup. On January 16th, we'll be gathering at <a href="https://blackstar.coop/eat/" target="_blank">Black Star Co-op</a> for a New Year Happy Hour.

<div align="center"><img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/SPQp3sukDaEtW/giphy.gif?cid=3640f6095c3de91647316c4f322303b1" /></div>


We'll meet slightly earlier than usual, at 5pm, to catch the last hour of the happy hour menu (<a href="https://blackstar.coop/eat/" target="_blank">see the menu here</a>) and hang out into early dinner for those interested in a bigger meal. <a href="https://www.fatcatsaustin.com/" target="_blank">Fat Cats</a> is also a few doors down for desserts and after-dinner coffee/treats.
