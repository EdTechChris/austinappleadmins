We had a great time hearing from [Bryson Tyrrell](https://twitter.com/bryson3gps) on how to set up a patch management server using his [Patch Server Startup Scripts](https://github.com/brysontyrrell/PatchServer) Thanks again to Jamf for providing pizza and more!

Below are the assets from the meetup, including the main deck and a recording of the Facebook Live video.
